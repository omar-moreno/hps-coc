\section{Core Principles}

\subsection{Respect and support members of the collaboration}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The collaboration is composed of members from different backgrounds whose
    diverse perspectives must be respected. 
    \item Acknowledge the privilege and power you hold and use it to empower 
    and amplify voices that are being excluded. 
    \item Criticism should be constructive and delivered in a respectful way
    with the aim of creating positive discussion. 
    \item Collaborators should feel supported in all situations; enabling 
    them to be creative in their ideas and solutions and thrive in our 
    community. 
    \item Avoid judging, discriminating, or making unwelcome jokes or disparaging remarks based on stereotypes
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Commit to openness}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Set aside implicit biases when hearing different perspectives, ideas and solutions.   
    \item Take it upon yourself to eliminate particular challenges or barriers to success that colleagues may face as members of under-represented groups
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Recognize that intent does not equate to impact}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The intention of your comments may not be to hurt but that does not
    mean that they didn't have a negative impact. 
\end{itemize}


\section{Guidelines}

\subsection{All spaces}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Be welcoming and open-minded. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Online}
\begin{itemize}
    \item When communicating online via a platform like Slack, make sure to 
    be clear and stay on topic.  Conveying tone and expressing sarcasm is much
    harder to do when communicating via text and is often misinterpreted. Take 
    more care to understand how your message will be perceived when 
    communicating online.
    \item Strive to improve discussions.  Engage in discussions with the 
    intent of having a positive impact on it.  
\end{itemize}
